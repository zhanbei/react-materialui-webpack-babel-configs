A template manager to make it easier to maintain a group of similar projects.

## Motivations

There are projects that use the same technical stack and therefore share some common files, which makes it painful to

0. create new projects with a set of existed configures;
0. maintain the configures of existed projects;
0. upgrade the configures of existed projects;

and this *Template Manager* is created to make it easier to maintain those projects.
